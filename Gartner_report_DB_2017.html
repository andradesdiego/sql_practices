The operational database management system (OPDBMS) market includes relational and nonrelational DBMS products suitable for a broad range of enterprise-level transactional applications (see Note 1 for a nonrelational DBMS explanation). The market also consists of DBMS products that support interactions and observations as alternative types of transactions. These OPDBMS products include purchased business applications, such as those for ERP, CRM, the Internet of Things (IoT), catalog management and security event management, plus custom transactional systems built by organizations' own development teams. (For a definition of an OPDBMS workload, see Note 2.)
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-1619472241">
Gartner defines a DBMS as a complete software system used to define, create, manage, update and query a database. A database is an organized collection of data that may be in multiple formats and may be stored in some form of storage medium (e.g., hard-disk drives, flash memory, solid-state drives and/or DRAM). Additionally, according to Gartner's definition, DBMSs provide interfaces to independent programs and tools that both support and govern the performance of a variety of concurrent workload types. There is no presupposition that DBMSs must support the relational model or the full set of possible data types in use today. OPDBMSs must include functionality to support backup and recovery, and have some form of transaction durability â€” although the atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability (ACID) model is not a requirement.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-1661277650">
OPDBMSs may support multiple delivery models, such as stand-alone DBMS software, certified configurations, cloud (public and private) images or versions, and database appliances (as defined in Note 3). These are discussed and evaluated together in the analysis of each vendor.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-559629134">
For the purposes of this Magic Quadrant, we treat all of a vendor's products as a set. If a vendor markets more than one DBMS product that can be used as an OPDBMS, we describe each product in the section specific to that vendor, but we evaluate all of that vendor's products together as a single entity. (Products from each of these vendors are specifically evaluated in the related Critical Capabilities document.) Strengths and Cautions relating to a specific offering or offerings are also noted in the individual vendor sections. It may be important for organizations to evaluate different offerings from the same vendor separately, as the portfolio of choices becomes broader and as purchasers more frequently pursue best-fit engineering strategies.

Nearly half of MapR reference customers cited missing features such as full ANSI SQL and secondary indexes as functionality gaps â€” the biggest proportion of all vendors evaluated. Reference customers also scored MapR's security capabilities well below average for encryption and data masking, and several references cited performance problems with Apache Drill. MapR has recently added secondary indexes and performance improvements to Apache Drill to address this.

We use the most recent generally available release of the software to evaluate current technical capabilities. We do not consider beta, &quot;early access,&quot; &quot;technology preview,&quot; &quot;ramp up&quot; or other, not generally available releases. For reference customers and reference survey responses, all versions currently used in production are considered. When older versions are in use, we consider whether later releases may have addressed reported issues, but also the rate at which customers move to newer versions.

Completeness of Vision

<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-1828492693">
Completeness of Vision encompasses a vendor's ability to understand the functional capabilities needed to support operational environments, to develop a product strategy that meets the market's requirements, to comprehend overall market trends and to influence or lead the market when necessary. A visionary leadership role is necessary for the long-term viability of both product and company. A vendor's vision may be demonstrated â€” and improved â€” by its willingness to extend its influence throughout the market by working with independent third-party application software vendors that deliver both added functionality for the operational environment and commercial off-the-shelf software. A successful vendor will be able not only to understand the competitive landscape of operational transactions, but also to shape its future.

assesses a vendor's ability to understand the market and shape its growth and vision. In addition to examining a vendor's core competencies in this market, we consider its awareness of new trends, such as the increasing sophistication of end users, growing scalability needs (especially across server clusters), the cloud as a platform for DBMSs, the demand for in-memory computing and HTAP, the use of new consistency models, and the growing desire to use data structures other than relational ones.

refers to a vendor's marketing themes, product R&amp;D focus, and its ability to choose appropriate target markets and third-party software vendor partnerships to enhance the marketability of its products. For example, we consider whether the vendor encourages and supports independent software vendors in its efforts to support its DBMS in native mode (via, for instance, co-marketing or co-advertising with &quot;value-added&quot; partners). This criterion includes the vendor's responses to the market trends identified above and any offers of alternative solutions in its marketing materials and plans.

Additionally, we consider reviews of publicly announced earnings and forward-looking statements relating to an intended market focus.

Hence, Leaders generally represent the lowest risk for customers in the areas of performance, scalability, reliability and support. As the market's demands change, so Leaders demonstrate strong vision in support not only of the market's current needs, but also of emerging trends. These include, but are not limited to, hybrid deployments and management, containerization, and diversity of operational processing and query capabilities. Finally, the messaging, product R&amp;D and delivery of Leaders are in line with today's market and with new trends in both DBMS software and hardware technology.

Challengers

</h4>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a98167007">
Challengers are stable vendors with strong, established offerings but a relative lack of vision. It is normal for some to have high scores for execution but to lag in terms of the adoption levels and vision needed for leadership. Challengers normally show strong corporate viability and financial stability, and demonstrate strong customer support. However, they lack some features to support the new trends in the OPDBMS market, such as support for interaction and observation data in transactions, and a roadmap for moving toward multimodel DBMS capabilities. Although they may be lacking in relation to some of the market's innovative concepts, Challengers offer stability, simplicity of installation and support, and strong performance. As with the Niche Players, Gartner considers support for only a limited number of data types and hardware models as evidence of limited vision.

Visionaries take a forward-thinking approach to managing the hardware, software and end-user aspects of an OPDBMS environment. Visionaries typically have innovative ideas for new functionality and advanced use of new hardware. They have the requisite number of production customers, but lack the market momentum of Leaders. In this market, Visionaries are often young, small and innovative vendors with great new ideas that are spurring on the more mature vendors and the market in general.

This Magic Quadrant deals with the key DBMS capabilities for operational processing. It should therefore interest anyone involved in defining, purchasing, building or managing an operational data processing environment â€” notably, CIOs, CTOs, data and analytics leaders, infrastructure managers, database and application architects, database administrators, and IT purchasing managers.

For 2017, cloud has moved to center stage. Extremely large companies, defined as having over 10,000 employees and several billion in annual revenue, are building roadmaps to be &quot;all in&quot; on public cloud infrastructure in three to five years. While it is unlikely that many will achieve their ambitious goals, it is clear that on-premises deployments will experience lower growth as organizations shift to cloud.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-531366026">
Vendors are supporting this transition by introducing or expanding their database platform as a service (dbPaaS) offerings. In this year's Magic Quadrant, at least seven vendors offer at least one dbPaaS product. Megavendors are the most visible in dbPaaS, but smaller vendors also have dbPaaS offerings with a unique value proposition: less vendor lock-in. It is unknown how much influence this message will have in the market.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-2140539851">
The focus on dbPaaS builds on our observation in 2016 that there is less focus on innovation as a differentiator, and more focus on engaging developers in the line of business (LOB) and making products easier to use. Incumbent and insurgent vendors face distinct difficulties to realize these objectives:
</span>
</p>
<ul class="bullets-yes">
<li>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1063290264">
Incumbent vendors must transition sales and marketing efforts to new audiences and new sales time frames. An 18-month sales cycle is no longer sustainable when end users are trying to capture new market opportunities faster than competitors are. Incumbent vendors must also mask product complexity until it is needed by DevOps staff.
</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1448932482">
Insurgent vendors, already skilled at selling to LOB developers, must continue to simplify their products while improving manageability, security, performance and stability.
</span>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1802192070">
Both groups of vendors must also continue developing expertise in running managed services for demanding clients. Megavendors can focus on their own cloud environments, but insurgent vendors must build expertise across multiple clouds.

Market Overview
</span>
</h2>
<div class="clearme"></div>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a2115255131">
The online transaction processing DBMS market, from which the OPDBMS market evolved, was very mature in the early 2000s. However, as internet usage and availability grew, so did the applications necessary to support the associated growth in infrastructure and the use cases to support them. Many new vendors therefore entered the OPDBMS market with products to support the specialized applications required by a new and global business arena.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-1275161486">
The explosive growth of features, and the vendors emerging to implement them, continue to slow. The features that initiated the expansion, such as storing new data types, geographically distributed storage, cloud and flexible data consistency models, have become common; today, nearly every established or emerging DBMS vendor supports them to some degree. In 2016, the OPDBMS market shifted from a phase of rapid innovation to a phase of maturing products and capabilities. This has continued into 2017.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1753627114">
Nearly all vendors in this market offer in-memory capabilities, multimodel, cloud (dbPaaS or a hosting model, or both) and HTAP programming capabilities. The smaller vendors in this market remain focused on execution. This is supported by our survey data, in which this year's scores are generally better for stability and support than 2016's, and converging more to the mean.

<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a967150195">
There is some movement toward innovation and vision from the larger, established vendors, especially toward support of streaming data and machine learning (ML). With the current industry focus on developing applications with ML, we now believe that this will lead to broader use of ML in DBMS optimization and maintenance tasks. This is clearly one of the new areas of innovation within the OPDBMS market. We will begin to see more self-managing features from these vendors. We also see many innovating in the cloud with features such as separation of compute and storage as well as new pricing models. We believe that this will spread even to on-premises over the next few years.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1081173246">
Finally, we are beginning to see a shift in the OPDBMS market and the DMSA market toward a single DBMS for both sets of use cases. It is becoming increasingly possible to use one vendor's product for both DMSA and OPDBMS needs, pushing those vendors that only fulfill one need toward the Niche Players quadrant. While there remains a need for best-of-fit solutions, the advantages of a single vendor from a cost and skills perspective many times outweigh the benefits from best-of-fit. This is just beginning in 2017 and will grow over the next several years.

As part of the Magic Quadrant research process, we sought the views of vendors' reference customers (details of whom were supplied by the vendors) via an online survey conducted during April and May 2017. The survey included requests for feedback about vendors' maturity (for example, typical use cases, provision of innovation, responsiveness to new requests, total cost of ownership and pricing) and product capabilities (for example, HA/DR capabilities, support for high-speed ingestion of data, performance, support for multiple data types, and problems encountered with the products).

<span class="annotate" id="a-122302068">
Previously, we have used the market term &quot;NoSQL&quot; to imply nonrelational; NoSQL formerly implied alternative data types and scaling strategies from relational DBMSs. However, relational DBMSs have added, or are adding, features from NoSQL, while NoSQL DBMSs have added, or are in the process of adding, features from relational DBMSs. Therefore, the term &quot;NoSQL&quot; is no longer useful as a product distinction.

<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-351964855">
While SQL is frequently associated with relational DBMS products, the availability of SQL does not define a relational DBMS. SQL is a data access language and can be used to access data in any DBMS, whether relational or nonrelational. Further, many of the nonrelational DBMSs have an SQL or SQL-like language (for example, MarkLogic and DataStax).
